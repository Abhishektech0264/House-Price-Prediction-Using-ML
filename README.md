# House-Price-Prediction-Using-ML
End-to-End machine learning project for house price prediction
# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning regression techniques.  
The goal is to build a model that generalizes well on unseen data.

## 📊 Dataset
- Housing price dataset
- Target variable: House Price

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## 📈 Model Performance
| Metric | Training | Testing |
|------|---------|--------|
| R² Score | ~0.99 | ~0.91 |
| MAE | ~0.01 | ~2.0 |

## 📉 Visualizations
- Actual vs Predicted prices
- Train and Test performance comparison

## ✅ Conclusion
The model achieves strong predictive performance with good generalization.  
Minor overfitting is observed but within acceptable limits.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering
- Model deployment
